# give_or_get
Sometimes anything is missing in our household. This can be domestic appliances such as a besom, a hand mixer or a TV. Wouldn't it be fantastic to find someone who can provide you with something you need and who is close to you? Probably, you get it for free, you can rent it for a period of time or get it for much cheaper prize and all that just some minutes away from you.  By just entering a key word for the item you search and the place you want to look for, you get all related items shown on a map. If you don't need something, but want to give something such as an old radio, don't hesitate and just upload it. There will be someone for sure like you, who want to get it.
